# This directory is the main directory for the conversation

## It is broken up into two sections:

### 1. [Tasks](tasks/)
This section is used to complete simple tasks like Siri and Alexa do to make our daily lives easier
such as finding classes, simple mathmatics, time and date retreivel and more.

### 2. [Research / Conversation](research/)
This section is used to store research into ways to teach the program how to build its
own responses to things that are said that aren't classified as "tasks."
