# This directory is intended for use in recognizing a user

# The [Face](face/)
The Face directory is used to recognize a person based on their facial features. This is done using dlib, a research based, neural net model that does facial feature detection to get an encoding of those features.

# The [Audio](audio/)
The Audio recognition is still in the research phase of production and is not yet ready to be used. However, promising signs are showing in this area. PyAudio is causing errors with this topic and recording voice is the next step as a model has been produced.

# The Multimodal
This python script trains a model for utilizing both face and audio together to recognize a person.
